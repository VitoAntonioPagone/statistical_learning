Notes
This dataset was derived from the 1990 U.S. Census, with one row per census block group—the smallest geographical unit published by the U.S. Census Bureau (typically 600–3,000 people).
Since average room and bedroom counts are given per household, these values can appear large in block groups with few households and many vacant homes (e.g., vacation areas).
