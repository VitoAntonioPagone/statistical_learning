<p align="center">
  <em>A minimal workspace for statistical intuition — where code meets curiosity.</em>
</p>

<hr style="width:60%; margin: 20px auto;">

<p align="center">
  A collection of Jupyter notebooks exploring statistical ideas through code.<br>
  Each project tests a concept, visualizes its behavior, and connects mathematical intuition with computation.
</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>
  This is not about prediction — it’s about understanding.<br>
  Each experiment begins with a simple question:<br>
  <strong>What really happens when this method runs?</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Models are built from scratch, assumptions are tested, and behavior is visualized on real data — 
  revealing how theory behaves when it touches reality.
</p>

<h2>Included Example</h2>

<p>
  <strong>OLS — Ordinary Least Squares</strong><br>
  An end-to-end exploration on the California Housing dataset, 
  from baseline models to polynomial extensions, showing the boundaries of interpretability in linear regression.
